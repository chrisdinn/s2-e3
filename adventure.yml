title: Lost in the Red Desert - An simple adventure game by Chris Dinn
greeting: |
    Last night, what a night. You awaken with little memory of how you arrived.
    The vicious hangover you're currently experiencing may be a clue.
    
    You seem to be in an old industrial part of town. Most nearby buildings
    appear abandoned. You're laying on the ground on an old dock, connected
    to an abandoned factory. 
    
    The water is only a few feet from where you're laying. Its oily surface reflects
    back the harsh sodium light above you with a kaliedescopic shimmer.
    
    You stand and look around. All you want is to find your way home.

        A empty dock, it seems like ships once unloaded their cargo here. There
        only seems to be one way out, through an old Factory.

        An empty parking lot with a large wall on it's west side. High up on the wall

    - name: a large crane
      description: |
        There's a south exit, but it's blocked by a large industrial crane. It looks like it
        would be easy enough to move it, but the controls don't seem to have any power.
        
        There's a large empty space that looks like it could hold a battery of some sort.

        A car battery, the big heavy kind.

        You insert the battery into the crane. It fits perfectly. You lean the crane control-stick 
        to one side and move it out of your way.
        
    - name: bus fare
      description: |
         Strange, but in the front seat of the truck there appears to be $2.25, just enough 
         to catch a city bus.
